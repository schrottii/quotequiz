    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    1. Click "Start Game" to start a game, containing 20 rounds!<br />
    2. In each round, a quote is presented, and 4 buttons of people who might have said it. Only one option is correct.<br />
    3. Each round has a time limit of 10 seconds. Trophies received are based on the answer speed, ranging from 1 to 10 (if faster than 1 second)<br />
    4. Answering incorrectly or letting the time run out takes the trophies from the question away. Answering slower does not.<br />
    Have fun!
